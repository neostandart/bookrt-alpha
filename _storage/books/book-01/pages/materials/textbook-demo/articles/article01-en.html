<p>Scientific article — a complete work of authorship describing the results of an original scientific research (primary scientific article) or devoted to the consideration of previously published scientific articles related to a common topic (review scientific article). In the primary scientific articles, the authors present essential information about the research in a form that allows other members of the scientific community to evaluate the research, reproduce the experiments, and evaluate the reasoning and conclusions drawn from them. Review scientific articles are intended for summarizing, analyzing, evaluating, summarizing, or synthesizing previously published information (primary scientific publications). Often, a scientific article combines these two types of scientific texts, including the review and original parts.</p>

<p>Currently, the main presentation for a scientific article is a printed form. This situation is gradually changing – some publishers, along with the publication of the printed issue of the journal, publish the texts of published scientific articles on the Internet for free access. However, in most cases, this is done for subscribers or on a paid basis, which means that there are virtually no articles on the Internet and makes it difficult for the researcher to find scientific information.</p>

<p>The project "CyberLeninka" is designed to correct the situation in this area. We provide a universal catalog, which contains many articles of various scientific journals, including those recommended by the Higher Attestation Commission of the Russian Federation, classified using the State Scientific and Technical Information Rubricator (GRNTI), in free access and free of charge.</p>
